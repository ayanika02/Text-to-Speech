"you can think of an API as a waiter in a restaurant who listens to your order request, goes to the chef, takes the food items ordered and gets back to you with the order",train_1.mp3
"Also, if you want to look for the working of an API with the example, here’s one",train_2.mp3
What is an API?,train_3.mp3
is when an API helps two programs or applications to communicate with each other by providing them with the necessary tools and functions,train_4.mp3
It takes the request from the user and sends it to the service provider and then again sends the result generated from the service provider to the desired user,train_5.mp3
helps software developers to access web tools while a GUI helps to make a program easier to understand for users,train_6.mp3
How do APIs Work?,train_7.mp3
APIs are considered safe in terms of attacks as it includes authorization credentials and an API gateway to limit access so as to minimize security threats,train_8.mp3
"To provide additional security layers to the data, HTTP headers, query string parameters, or cookies are used",train_9.mp3
(Extensible Markup Language),train_10.mp3
How is an API Different From a Web Application?,train_11.mp3
The difference between an API and a web application is that API allows two-way communication and web applications are just a way for users to interact through a web browser,train_12.mp3
A web application may have an API to complete the requests,train_13.mp3
"an open-source interface and can be used by a large number of clients through their phones, tablets, or PCs",train_14.mp3
"In this type of API, the programmers get the local middleware services",train_15.mp3
"TAPI (Telephony Application Programming Interface), and .NET are common examples of Local APIs",train_16.mp3
It makes a remote program appear to be local by making use of RPCs (Remote Procedural Calls),train_17.mp3
SOAP is a well-known example of this type of API,train_18.mp3
It defines messages in XML format used by web applications to communicate with each other,train_19.mp3
"It makes use of HTTP to GET, POST, PUT, or DELETE data",train_20.mp3
It is basically used to take advantage of the existing data,train_21.mp3
It uses JSON for data transfer and is a lightweight remote procedural call defining a few data structure types,train_22.mp3
It is based on XML and uses HTTP for data transfer,train_23.mp3
This API is widely used to exchange information between two or more networks,train_24.mp3
What are REST APIs?,train_25.mp3
"Its main feature is that REST API is stateless, i.e., the servers do not save clients’ data between requests",train_26.mp3
What is a Web API?,train_27.mp3
Web API Is simply an API for the web,train_28.mp3
It is an API that can be accessed using the HTTP protocol,train_29.mp3
"It can be built using Java, .nET, etc",train_30.mp3
"It is implemented to extend the functionality of a browser, simplify complex functions, and provide easy syntax to complex code",train_31.mp3
"It permits different data formats such as plain text, HTML, XML, JSON, etc",train_32.mp3
What is API (Application Programming Interface) Integration?,train_33.mp3
"API (Application Programming Interface) Integration is the connection between two or more applications, via APIs, letting you exchange data",train_34.mp3
It is a medium through which you can share data and communicate with each other by involving APIs to allow web tools to communicate,train_35.mp3
"Due to the rise in cloud-based products, API integration has become very important",train_36.mp3
What is API (Application Programming Interface) Testing?,train_37.mp3
"is a kind of software testing that analyzes an API in terms of its functionality, security, performance, and reliability",train_38.mp3
It is very important to test an API so as to check whether it’s working as expected or not,train_39.mp3
"If not, again changes are made in the architecture and re-verified",train_40.mp3
APIs are the center of software development to exchange data across applications,train_41.mp3
The API testing includes sending requests to single/multiple API endpoints and validating the response,train_42.mp3
"It focuses majorly on business logic, data responses and security, and performance bottlenecks",train_43.mp3
How to Create APIs?,train_44.mp3
These APIs are only made for a single person or entity (like a company that has spent the resources to make it or bought it),train_45.mp3
Just like the name it gives the authority to use APIs to some partners of entities that own APIs for their private use,train_46.mp3
"API produces efficient, quicker, and more reliable results than the outputs produced by human beings in an organization",train_47.mp3
API provides fast and flexible delivery of services according to developers’ requirements,train_48.mp3
The best feature of API is that it allows the movement of data between various sites and thus enhances the integrated user experience,train_49.mp3
"As API makes use of robotic computers rather than humans, it produces better and more automated results",train_50.mp3
: While using API the developers find new tools and functionality for API exchanges,train_51.mp3
Developing and implementing API is costly at times and requires high maintenance and support from developers,train_52.mp3
"Using API adds another layer of surface which is then prone to attacks, and hence the security risk problem is common in APIs",train_53.mp3
"it’s working, types, testing tools used, etc",train_54.mp3
"After understanding these concepts, you can try working on them by implementing some of the concepts in projects",train_55.mp3
"Not just theoretical knowledge, you must also have a practical idea of it by working on it",train_56.mp3
Developers must have a deep understanding of APIs in order to implement them,train_57.mp3
What API means?,train_58.mp3
"Application Programming Interface (API), often referred to as web API, is an interface that allows two systems to communicate with each other (share data and access resources)",train_59.mp3
One of its purposes includes making visible the internal details of how a system works to only those that a programmer finds required,train_60.mp3
What are the 4 types of API (Application Programming Interface)?,train_61.mp3
What is an example of an API?,train_62.mp3
We can take Zomato as an example to explain the concept of an API,train_63.mp3

Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud,train_151.mp3
It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology,train_152.mp3
TTS can take words on a computer or other digital device and convert them into audio,train_153.mp3
"TTS is very helpful for kids who struggle with reading, but it can also help kids with writing and editing, and even focusing.",train_154.mp3
Text-to-speech (TTS) is a type of assistive technology that reads digital text aloud,train_155.mp3
It’s sometimes called “read aloud” technology.,train_156.mp3
"With a click of a button or the touch of a finger, TTS can take words on a computer or other digital device and convert them into audio",train_157.mp3
TTS is very helpful for kids who struggle with reading,train_158.mp3
"But it can also help kids with writing and editing, and even focusing.",train_159.mp3
"TTS works with nearly every personal digital device, including computers, smartphones and tablets",train_160.mp3
"All kinds of text files can be read aloud, including Word and Pages documents",train_161.mp3
Even online web pages can be read aloud.,train_162.mp3
"The voice in TTS is computer-generated, and reading speed can usually be sped up or slowed down",train_163.mp3
"Voice quality varies, but some voices sound human",train_164.mp3
There are even computer-generated voices that sound like children speaking.,train_165.mp3
Many TTS tools highlight words as they are read aloud,train_166.mp3
This allows kids to see text and hear it at the same time.,train_167.mp3
Some TTS tools also have a technology called optical character recognition (OCR),train_168.mp3
OCR allows TTS tools to read text aloud from images,train_169.mp3
"For example, your child could take a photo of a street sign and have the words on the sign turned into audio.",train_170.mp3
Print materials in the classroom — like books and handouts — can create obstacles for kids with reading issues,train_171.mp3
That’s because some kids struggle with decoding and understanding printed words on the page,train_172.mp3
Using digital text with TTS helps remove these barriers.,train_173.mp3
"Like audiobooks, TTS won’t slow down the development of your child’s reading skills.",train_174.mp3
"It’s important to teach to each student’s individual strengths, skills and needs",train_175.mp3
This is true for all kids — not just kids with learning and attention issues.,train_176.mp3
It’s a good idea to start the conversation with your child’s teacher if you think your child would benefit from TTS,train_177.mp3
"If your child has an Individualized Education Program (IEP) or a 504 plan, your child has a right to the assistive technology she needs to learn",train_178.mp3
"But even without an IEP or a 504 plan, a school may be willing to provide TTS if it can help your child.",train_179.mp3
You can also use TTS at home,train_180.mp3

The YubiKey supports the Initiative for Open Authentication (OATH) standards for generating one-time password (OTP)codes,train_188.mp3
"Using this application, a YubiKey can be configured with multiple OTP credentials in a manner similar to thatfound in software authenticators",train_189.mp3
"Unlike a software only solution, the credentials are stored in the YubiKey itself andcan roam between your devices",train_190.mp3
"Simply plug the YubiKey into a device that has YubiKey OATH-enabled software, and yourcredentials will be there.",train_191.mp3
The YubiKey-generated one-time passcodes can be used as one of the authentication options in your application'stwo-factor or multi-factor authentication workflow,train_192.mp3
A 6 or 8 digit passcode is not strong enough to stand on its own; itis often used to augment the user's primary credentials.,train_193.mp3
"An OTP is similar to a password, however it can only be used once",train_194.mp3
It is often used in combination with a regularpassword as an additional authentication mechanism providing extra security.,train_195.mp3
The OTP code is generated using two inputs: a shared secret and a moving factor,train_196.mp3
The secret is a static value that iscreated when you establish a new credential,train_197.mp3
"It is only communicated once, and is stored on both the authenticator (theYubiKey) and the authentication server",train_198.mp3
The moving factor changes each time a new OTP is requested,train_199.mp3
The way the movingfactor is generated and agreed upon is different for HOTP and TOTP credentials.,train_200.mp3
HOTP stands for HMAC-based One-time Password algorithm (HOTP),train_201.mp3
The algorithm is specifiedin RFC 4226.,train_202.mp3
It is an event-based OTP where the moving factor is based on a counter,train_203.mp3
"Each time the HOTP is requested and validated,the moving factor is incremented based on a counter",train_204.mp3
The code that is generated is valid until you actively requestanother one and the authentication server validates it,train_205.mp3
"The OTP generator and the server are synchronized each time thecode is validated, and the user gains access.",train_206.mp3
TOTP stands for Time-based One-time Password (TOTP),train_207.mp3
The algorithm is specifiedin RFC 6238.,train_208.mp3
The moving factor in a TOTP is time-based rather than counter-based.,train_209.mp3
The amount of time in which each password is valid is called a timestep,train_210.mp3
"The default timestep is 30 seconds, but it canalso be 15 or 60 seconds",train_211.mp3
"If you have not used your password within that window, it will no longer be valid, and youwill need to request a new one to gain access to your application.",train_212.mp3
HOTP credentials do not have an expiration period,train_213.mp3
TOTP improves HOTP by using the current time as the moving factor.TOTP credentials have the advantage of being valid for a limited time period  the timestep,train_214.mp3
"So if the generated code isnot used within a certain period of seconds, it expires and can not be used for login.",train_215.mp3
"TOTP credentials tend to be more secure because they're only valid for a certain period of time, which adds a certainlayer of security",train_216.mp3
The fact of adding an extra factor that needs to be met increases the security of the code,train_217.mp3
TOTPs areconsidered an evolved form of HOTPs they imply more security because of having an extra factor to meet the algorithmconditions.,train_218.mp3
"Since HOTP doesnt have the time-based limitation, its a little more user-friendly but may be more susceptible to bruteforce attacks",train_219.mp3
Thats because of a potentially longer window in which the HOTP is valid.,train_220.mp3
"Also, HOTP can have a synchronization problem",train_221.mp3
"The HOTP counter is incremented each time the button is tapped, while theserver counter is incremented only when a password is successfully validated",train_222.mp3
"For this reason, HOTP validating serversaccept a range of OTPs",train_223.mp3
"Specifically, they will accept an OTP generated by a counter within a set number of incrementsfrom the previous counter value stored on the server",train_224.mp3
This range is the validation window,train_225.mp3
"If the token counter isoutside of the window allowed by the server, the validation fails, and the token must be re-synchronized",train_226.mp3
The larger thewindow - the greater the chance of an adversary guessing one of the accepted OTPs through a brute-force attack.,train_227.mp3
The HOTP algorithm is practical and sound,train_228.mp3
The possible brute force attack can be prevented by careful implementation ofcountermeasures in the validation server.,train_229.mp3
"However, given TOTP's advantages over the HOTP protocol, TOTP should be favored whenever possible.",train_230.mp3
"When using OATH with a YubiKey, the shared secrets are stored and processed in the YubiKeys secure element",train_231.mp3
This hastwo advantages over software-only solutions:,train_232.mp3
Security,train_233.mp3
The secrets always stay within the YubiKey,train_234.mp3
"A phone can get stolen, sold, infected by malware, have its storage readby a connected computer, etc.",train_235.mp3
Accessibility,train_236.mp3
You can display OATH codes on more than one phone or computer,train_237.mp3
"If your phone runs out of battery, you can get a codeusing a friends phone or your computer.",train_238.mp3
All OATH operations can be divided into three groups with related types of functionality:,train_239.mp3

Varonis is rated #1 overall in three Gartner Peer Insights markets.,train_248.mp3
We’ve talked about giving away your passwords and how you should never do it,train_249.mp3
"When a website wants to use the services of another—such as Bitly posting to your Twitter stream—instead of asking you to share your password, they should use a protocol called OAuth instead.",train_250.mp3
"It’s important to understand how a program, website, or app might authenticate you as a user – do they have the right permissions? Have you granted them some sort of way of verifying who you are – and accessing data on your behalf? OAuth helps streamline this process: but even with automation, always be aware of how a person or company uses (or stores) your data.",train_251.mp3
"OAuth is an open-standard authorization protocol or framework that provides applications the ability for “secure designated access.” For example, you can tell Facebook that it’s OK for ESPN.com to access your profile or post updates to your timeline without having to give ESPN your Facebook password",train_252.mp3
"This minimizes risk in a major way: In the event ESPN suffers a breach, your Facebook password remains safe.",train_253.mp3
OAuth doesn’t share password data but instead uses authorization tokens to prove an identity between consumers and service providers,train_254.mp3
OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows you to approve one application interacting with another on your behalf without giving away your password.,train_255.mp3
SAML (Security Assertion Markup Language) is an alternative federated authentication standard that many enterprises use for Single-Sign On (SSO),train_256.mp3
SAML enables enterprises to monitor who has access to corporate resources.,train_257.mp3
There are many differences between SAML and OAuth,train_258.mp3
"SAML uses XML to pass messages, and OAuth uses JSON",train_259.mp3
"OAuth provides a simpler mobile experience, while SAML is geared towards enterprise security",train_260.mp3
"That last point is a key differentiator: OAuth uses API calls extensively, which is why mobile applications, modern web applications, game consoles, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices find OAuth a better experience for the user",train_261.mp3
"SAML, on the other hand, drops a session cookie in a browser that allows a user to access certain web pages – great for short-lived work days, but not so great when have to log into your thermostat every day.",train_262.mp3
Oauth/SAML helps with who is accessing your network but you need Varonis to complete the picture of what they're doing and what sensitive data they're accessing.,train_263.mp3
"The simplest example of OAuth in action is one website saying “hey, do you want to log into our website with other website’s login?” In this scenario, the only thing the first website – let’s refer to that website as the consumer – wants to know is that the user is the same user on both websites and has logged in successfully to the service provider – which is the site the user initially logged into, not the consumer.",train_264.mp3
Facebook apps are a good OAuth use case example,train_265.mp3
"Say you’re using an app on Facebook, and it asks you to share your profile and pictures",train_266.mp3
"Facebook is, in this case, the service provider: it has your login data and your pictures",train_267.mp3
"The app is the consumer, and as the user, you want to use the app to do something with your pictures",train_268.mp3
"You specifically gave this app access to your pictures, which OAuth is managing in the background.",train_269.mp3
"Your smart home devices – toaster, thermostat, security system, etc",train_270.mp3
– probably use some kind of login data to sync with each other and allow you to administer them from a browser or client device,train_271.mp3
These devices use what OAuth calls confidential authorization,train_272.mp3
"That means they hold onto the secret key information, so you don’t have to log in over and over again.",train_273.mp3
OAuth is about authorization and not authentication,train_274.mp3
Authorization is asking for permission to do stuff,train_275.mp3
Authentication is about proving you are the correct person because you know things,train_276.mp3
OAuth doesn’t pass authentication data between consumers and service providers – but instead acts as an authorization token of sorts.,train_277.mp3
The common analogy I’ve seen used while researching OAuth is the valet key to your car,train_278.mp3
The valet key allows the valet to start and move the car but doesn’t give them access to the trunk or the glove box.,train_279.mp3
An OAuth token is like that valet key,train_280.mp3
"As a user, you get to tell the consumers what they can use and what they can’t use from each service provider",train_281.mp3
You can give each consumer a different valet key,train_282.mp3
They never have the full key or any of the private data that gives them access to the full key.,train_283.mp3
"There are 3 main players in an OAuth transaction: the user, the consumer, and the service provider.  This triumvirate has been affectionately deemed the OAuth Love Triangle.",train_284.mp3
The secret is used to prevent request forgery,train_285.mp3
The consumer uses the secret to sign each request so that the service provider can verify it is actually coming from the consumer application.,train_286.mp3
This is the scary part. If Bitly were super-shady Evil Co,train_287.mp3
"it could pop up a window that looked like Twitter but was really phishing for your username and password.  Always be sure to verify that the URL you’re directed to is actually the service provider (Twitter, in this case).",train_288.mp3
"Twitter marks the request token as “good-to-go,” so when the consumer requests access, it will be accepted (so long as it’s signed using their shared secret).",train_289.mp3
"In our scenario, Joe never had to share his Twitter credentials with Bitly.  He simply delegated access using OAuth in a secure manner.  At any time, Joe can login to Twitter and review the access he has granted and revoke tokens for specific applications without affecting others.  OAuth also allows for granular permission levels.  You can give Bitly the right to post to your Twitter account, but restrict LinkedIn to read-only access.",train_290.mp3
"OAuth 2.0 is a complete redesign from OAuth 1.0, and the two are not compatible",train_291.mp3
"If you create a new application today, use OAuth 2.0",train_292.mp3
"This blog only applies to OAuth 2.0, since OAuth 1.0 is deprecated.",train_293.mp3
OAuth 2.0 is faster and easier to implement,train_294.mp3
"OAuth 1.0 used complicated cryptographic requirements, only supported three flows, and did not scale.",train_295.mp3
"OAuth 2.0, on the other hand, has six flows for different types of applications and requirements and enables signed secrets over HTTPS",train_296.mp3
OAuth tokens no longer need to be encrypted on the endpoints in 2.0 since they are encrypted in transit.,train_297.mp3
"Hopefully, this was a good primer to get you familiar with OAuth so the next time you see “Sign-in with Twitter” or similar delegated identity verification, you’ll have a good idea of what is going on.",train_298.mp3

REST is an acronym forREpresentationalStateTransfer and an architectural style fordistributed hypermedia systems,train_305.mp3
Roy Fielding first presented it in 2000 in his famousdissertation,train_306.mp3
Since then it has become one of the most widely used approaches for building web-based APIs (Application Programming Interfaces).,train_307.mp3
"REST is not a protocol or a standard, it is an architectural style",train_308.mp3
"During the development phase, API developers can implement REST in a variety of ways.",train_309.mp3
"Like the other architectural styles, REST also has its guiding principles and constraints",train_310.mp3
These principles must be satisfied if a service interface has to be referred to asRESTful.,train_311.mp3
A Web API (or Web Service) conforming to the REST architectural style is called aREST API (or RESTful API).,train_312.mp3
"By applying theprinciple of generalityto the components interface, we can simplify the overall system architecture and improve the visibility of interactions",train_313.mp3
Multiple architectural constraints help in obtaining a uniform interface and guiding the behavior of components.,train_314.mp3
"In simpler words, REST defines a consistent and uniform interface for interactions between clients and servers",train_315.mp3
"For example, the HTTP-based REST APIs make use of the standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) and the URIs (Uniform Resource Identifiers) to identify resources.",train_316.mp3
"The client-server design pattern enforces theseparation of concerns, which helps the client and the server components evolve independently.",train_317.mp3
"By separating the user interface concerns (client) from the data storage concerns (server), we improve the portability of the user interface across multiple platforms and improve scalability by simplifying the server components.",train_318.mp3
"While the client and the server evolve, we have to make sure that the interface/contract between the client and the server does not break.",train_319.mp3
Statelessnessmandates that each request from the client to the server must contain all of the information necessary to understand and complete the request.,train_320.mp3
The server cannot take advantage of any previously stored context information on the server.,train_321.mp3
"For this reason, the client application must entirely keep the session state.",train_322.mp3
Thecacheable constraintrequires that a response should implicitly or explicitly label itself as cacheable or non-cacheable.,train_323.mp3
"If the response is cacheable, the client application gets the right to reuse the response data later for equivalent requests and a specified period.",train_324.mp3
The layered system style allows an architecture to be composed of hierarchical layers by constraining component behavior,train_325.mp3
"In a layered system, each component cannot see beyond the immediate layer they are interacting with.",train_326.mp3
A layman’s example of a layered system is the MVC pattern,train_327.mp3
"The MVC pattern allows for a clear separation of concerns, making it easier to develop, maintain, and scale the application.",train_328.mp3
REST also allows client functionality to extend by downloading and executing code in the form of applets or scripts.,train_329.mp3
The downloaded code simplifies clients by reducing the number of features required to be pre-implemented,train_330.mp3
"Servers can provide part of features delivered to the client in the form of code, and the client only needs to execute the code.",train_331.mp3
The keyabstraction of informationin REST is aresource,train_332.mp3
Any information that we can name can be a resource,train_333.mp3
"For example, a REST resource can be a document or image, a temporal service, a collection of other resources, or a non-virtual object (e.g., a person).",train_334.mp3
A REST API consists of an assembly of interlinked resources,train_335.mp3
This set of resources is known as the REST API’sresource model.,train_336.mp3
REST usesresource identifiersto identify each resource involved in the interactions between the client and the server components.,train_337.mp3
The data format of a representation is known as amedia type,train_338.mp3
The media type identifies a specification that defines how a representation is to be processed.,train_339.mp3
A RESTful API looks likehypertext,train_340.mp3
"Every addressable unit of information carries an address, either explicitly (e.g., link and id attributes) or implicitly (e.g., derived from the media type definition and representation structure).",train_341.mp3
Hypertext (or hypermedia) means thesimultaneous presentation of information and controlssuch that the information becomes the affordance through which the user (or automaton) obtains choices and selects actions.,train_342.mp3
Remember that hypertext does not need to be HTML (or XML or JSON) on a browser,train_343.mp3
Machines can follow links when they understand the data format and relationship types.,train_344.mp3
"Further,resource representations shall be self-descriptive: the client does not need to know if a resource is an employee or a device",train_345.mp3
It should act based on the media type associated with the resource.,train_346.mp3
"So in practice, we will create lots ofcustom media types– usually one media type associated with one resource.",train_347.mp3
Every media type defines a default processing model,train_348.mp3
"For example, HTML defines a rendering process for hypertext and the browser behavior around each element.",train_349.mp3
Consider the following REST resource that represents a blog post with links to related resources in an HTTP-based REST API,train_350.mp3
"This has the necessary information about the blog post, as well as the hypermedia links to the related resources such as author and comments",train_351.mp3
Clients can follow these links to discover additional information or perform actions.,train_352.mp3
Another important thing associated with REST isresource methods,train_353.mp3
These resource methods are used to perform the desired transition between two states of any resource.,train_354.mp3
"A large number of people wrongly relate resource methods toHTTP methods(i.e., GET/PUT/POST/DELETE)",train_355.mp3
Roy Fielding has never mentioned any recommendation around which method to use in which condition,train_356.mp3
All he emphasizes is that it should be auniform interface.,train_357.mp3
"For example, if we decide that the application APIs will use HTTP POST for updating a resource – rather than most people recommend HTTP PUT – it’s all right",train_358.mp3
"Still, the application interface will be RESTful.",train_359.mp3
"Ideally, everything needed to transition the resource state shall be part of the resource representation – including all the supported methods and what form they will leave the representation.",train_360.mp3
"We should enter a REST API with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (a bookmark) and a set of standardized media types appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be understood by any client that might use the API).",train_361.mp3
"From that point on, all application state transitions must be driven by the client selection of server-provided choices present in the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations.",train_362.mp3
Many people prefer to compare HTTP with REST.REST and HTTP are not the same.,train_363.mp3
"Though REST also intends to make the web (internet) more streamlined and standard, Roy Fielding advocates using REST principles more strictly",train_364.mp3
And that’s where people try to start comparing REST with the web.,train_365.mp3
"Roy Fielding, in his dissertation, has nowhere mentioned any implementation direction – including any protocol preference or even HTTP",train_366.mp3
"Till the time, we are honoring the six guiding principles of REST, which we can call our interface – RESTful.",train_367.mp3
"In simple words, in the REST architectural style, data and functionality are considered resources and are accessed usingUniform Resource Identifiers(URIs).",train_368.mp3
"The resources are acted upon by using a set of simple, well-defined operations",train_369.mp3
"Also, the resources have to be decoupled from their representation so that clients can access the content in various formats, such as HTML, XML, plain text, PDF, JPEG, JSON, and others.",train_370.mp3
The clients and servers exchange representations of resources by using a standardized interface and protocol,train_371.mp3
"Typically HTTP is the most used protocol, but REST does not mandate it.",train_372.mp3
"Metadata about the resource is made available and used to control caching, detect transmission errors, negotiate the appropriate representation format, and perform authentication or access control.",train_373.mp3
"And most importantly, every interaction with the server must be stateless.",train_374.mp3
"All these principles help RESTful applications to be simple, lightweight, and fast.",train_375.mp3
"The sky turned a shade of orange as the sun set behind the mountains, casting long shadows across the empty fields below",train_376.mp3
" Birds chirped noisily as they flew back to their nests, signaling the end of another day",train_377.mp3
